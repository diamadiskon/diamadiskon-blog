On October 20, 2025, AWS faced a major outage in its US-EAST-1 region one of the most heavily used cloud regions in the world. The root cause was a critical DNS resolution issue that affected core services like DynamoDB, EC2, Lambda, and ECS.

As a result, countless applications suddenly couldn't reach their data or backend services. The disruption rippled across the internet, bringing down parts of Snapchat, Reddit, Coinbase, and even Fortnite for several hours. Although AWS engineers eventually mitigated the problem, the impact was global affecting millions of users and businesses that rely on AWS infrastructure every day.

For DevOps teams, incidents like this serve as a powerful reminder: no cloud provider is infallible. Even the biggest and most sophisticated platforms can experience unexpected failures. And when that happens, businesses that rely solely on one cloud provider can find themselves completely offline.

That's where multi-cloud comes in.

A multi-cloud strategy distributes workloads across multiple providers (for example, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud) to reduce dependency on any single platform. Beyond just redundancy, multi-cloud offers several real-world advantages:

- No vendor lock-in: You stay flexible by avoiding deep ties to one provider's ecosystem.
- Best of both worlds: Different clouds excel in different areas use each where it shines.
- High availability and resilience: If one provider faces downtime, critical services can fail over to another.
- Cost efficiency: You can strategically place workloads where it's most cost-effective.
- Better compliance and coverage: Regional and regulatory requirements become easier to meet.

The truth is, cloud failures will happen whether it's due to network issues, DNS problems, or internal bugs. But by designing with multi-cloud resilience in mind, DevOps teams can ensure that such outages are mere speed bumps, not roadblocks.

The AWS East 1 outage is a clear example of why resilience should never be an afterthought. For organizations that rely on cloud infrastructure to keep the lights on, it's time to start thinking beyond a single provider and start building for a world where uptime truly matters.
